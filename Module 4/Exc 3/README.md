# Collections and LINQ
## Exercise: Work with collections
It's required to implement method <code>CreateProjectInfos</code> which takes 2 collections with different objects (<code>IEnumerable&lt;Project&gt;</code> and <code>IEnumerable&lt;Attachment&gt;</code>) and returns <code>IEnumerable&lt;ProjectInfo&gt;</code>.  

## Knowledge required
1. Basic collections supported in .NET (part of BCL) and their properties, methods
2. LINQ

## Guidlines
1. Download exercise solution locally and open it in IDE (e.g. Visual Studio)
2. Implement 1 method <code>CreateProjectInfos</code> in the <code>ProjectInfoBuilder</code> class
3. Debug and test your implementation.  
E.g. *Tests* project contains set of unit tests which can be used to check solution.

## Extra points
1. Think whether any additional tests can be added to check implementation (e.g. consider edge cases).
2. Think and estimate your implementation execution time and memory consuptions depends on the size of input data (computational complexity).
